# Example React To-Do application

A small and simple to-do application that operates like a series of post-it notes.

This is also an exploration of Webpack, React Hot Module Reloading, and more.

## Installing

Right now this application is still being worked on, and will have a production build process in the future.

In the meantime you can run `npm install` and then `npm run dev` to start the dev server.
